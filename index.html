		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Hi there. I'm Justin Piper, a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Bioinformatics.
			I am also a software developer with experience in a number of different languages, particularly Java, Python, Groovy, HTML,
			CSS, and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's more to me than a nerd with his keyboard, though. I am an avid sports fan, and root for Pittsburgh teams across the
			board. My favorite sport is baseball, but I also enjoy football, hockey, basketball, and golf.

		<h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
		<p>
      I like to describe myself as an avid reader, though unfortunately I often don't have time to read as much as
      I'd like to during the semester. With that caveat in mind, I'll try to keep this list of books I've enjoyed as
      up-to-date as possible.
    </p>
