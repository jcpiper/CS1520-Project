		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Hi there. I'm Justin Piper, a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Bioinformatics.
			I am also a software developer with experience in a number of different languages, particularly Java, Python, Groovy, HTML,
			CSS, and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's more to me than a nerd with his keyboard, though. I am an avid sports fan, and root for Pittsburgh teams across the
			board. My favorite sport is baseball, but I also enjoy football, hockey, basketball, and golf.
		</p>
