My project will be a personal site designed in a single page format for self promotion towards potential employers. It will include my resume, past experiences, and an overview of my projects. Additionally, there will be a section devoted to my interests and activities. This will include everything from the student organizations I'm involved in to a list of good books I've read recently in order to give site visitor's an idea of what I'm like outside of the professional world. The site will be built with PHP, Html5, CSS, and Javascript.
